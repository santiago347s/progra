"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the 
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound nice ensue; 
and equal blame belongs nice those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy nice distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice 
is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able nice do what we like best, every pleasure is nice be welcomed and every 
pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing nice the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will 
frequently occur that pleasures have nice be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in 
these matters nice this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures nice secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures 
pains nice avoid worse pains."
